### Instructions

1. **Prepare ingredients**: 
   - Ensure your rice is cold and clumped slightly for easy separation.
   - Chop vegetables finely for even cooking.

2. **Heat the pan**:
   - Use a wok or large skillet. Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.

3. **Cook the eggs**:
   - Push the rice aside or remove it temporarily.
   - Crack eggs directly into the pan. Let them set slightly, then scramble.

4. **Sauté garlic and vegetables**:
   - Add minced garlic and your choice of vegetables. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until fragrant and vegetables are tender.

5. **Add rice**:
   - Add the rice to the pan, breaking up clumps with a spatula or spoon. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes to warm the rice through and give it a slightly crispy texture.

6. **Season**:
   - Pour soy sauce, sesame oil, and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice. Stir to coat evenly.
   - Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

7. **Combine everything**:
   - Toss the scrambled eggs back in, mixing well with the rice.
   - Add any optional proteins at this stage, ensuring they’re fully cooked.

8. **Garnish and serve**:
   - Remove from heat and garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds.
   - Serve hot and enjoy!

### Tips for Success:
1. **Use day-old rice**: Fresh rice can be too moist, making the dish mushy.
2. **Work quickly**: Keep the pan hot and ingredients moving to prevent sticking.
3. **Customize**: Add your favorite proteins, spices (like chili oil), or other sauces for variety.
